# Summary

`vfl2code` is a tool to convert VFL (Visual Formatting Language) based UI layout to native, frame-based, Objective-C or Swift code.

# Usage

## 1. One-time setup

```
sudo ./setup.rb
```

## 2. Integrate with your Xcode project

Navigate to your target, click "Build Phases", click "+", add a "New Run Script Phase", drag it to before "Compile Sources".

Inside the script editing field, type

    vfl2code.rb -A ${PROJECT_DIR}

or

    vfl2code.rb -A ${PROJECT_DIR}/some_folder

where some_folder is the folder where you have all your Objective C and Swift code files.

## 3. Create a VFL code block

To start a new VFL based code block, enter something like below in the right place in your code:

    UIView* superview = someView;
    // begin VFL
    /*
        |-10-[someElement]-10-|
        V:|-5-[someElement(100)]
    */
    // end VFL

*Note:* the first line and the last line are important. The final `// end VFL` must be followed by a LF line break (`\n`). You can also `// VFL begin` and `// VFL end`

You can also type vflswift or vflobjc to trigger the code snippet and insert the basic structure.

## 4. Build/Run the project

# Sample Rules

```
|-5-[A(100)]
```
This means that element A is 5 points from the left edge of its container, and it's 100 points wide. And A has flexible right margin.

```
V:|-10-[B(50)]
```
This means that element B is 10 points from the top edge and is 50 points tall. (V means vertical). And B has flexible bottom margin.

```
|-5-[C]-5-|
```
This means that C has flexible width, and it's 5 points to the left edge and 5 points to the right edge.

```
V:[D]|
```
This means that D is touching the bottom edge, and have a flexible top margin, and D's height should be set beyond the VFL based block (either before or after)

```
|-5-[E]-5-[F(50)]-5-[G(>0)]-5-|
```
This means that E has a fixed width set outside the VFL block, F has a fixed width of 50 points, G has a flexible width

```
[H(100)]
```
This means that H is 100 points wide. However **it's position and autoresizing mask is unknown, so you need to set them beyond the VFL block**.

# A rule of thumb

The rule of thumb is that there can be 1 and only 1 flexible element in each dimension:

```
|-5-[A(100)]-5-|
```
This is wrong because when the superview width is not 110 there will be a conflict.

```
|-5-[A(>0)]-5-[B(>0)]-5-|
```
This is wrong because it is an ambiguous layoutâ€”it is unclear on how to assign the widths for A and B.

# Variables and constants

Variables and constants can be used to replace the numbers:

```
|-margin-[button(width)]
```

Everything else follows [Apple's official VFL documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/VisualFormatLanguage/VisualFormatLanguage.html), with one exception: `vlf2objc` supports `center` before brackets.

```
center[A(200)]
```
This means A's width is 200 and A is horizontally centered in its superview.

```
V:center[B(100)]
```
This means B's height is 100 and B is vertically centered in its superview.

# Frame overriding

**Unlike** Cocoa Autolayout, `vfl2code` allows you to override the frame of an element before or after the generated code block.

For example this is valid allowed:

    labelA.text = @"hi";
    [labelA sizeToFit];
    // generated code based on |-[labelA]-10-[itemB]

This is also valid and allowed:

    // generated code based on [itemX(100)]
    UpdateWidthBasedOnSomeLogic(itemX); // this keeps the x, y, height set in the VFL block and just updates the width

However, the following example will not work:

    // generated code based on |[itemX]-[itemY(100)]
    [itemX setWidth:100];

`itemY`'s position depends on `itemX`'s frame, so `itemX`'s `setWidth` call must go before the generated code block.


Command line tools
==================

You can use this script to convert raw VFL to Objective-C code from command line:

    echo "|-10-[button]
    V:[button]-|" | vfl2code.rb --raw

Or convert an Objective-C source code file, preserving non-VFL areas. To do so, run either:

    cat yourfile.swift | vfl2code.rb --swift > yourfile_with_changes.swift

Or transform it in place:

    vfl2code.rb -f yourfile.m

Or transform a folder recursively in place:

    vfl2code.rb -A yourfile.m

You can use -a to dry run.
